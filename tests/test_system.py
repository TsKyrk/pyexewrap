"""System-level environment checks for pyexewrap double-click invocation.

Unlike the unit tests in test_pyexewrap.py (which call run_script() directly
and always pass regardless of Windows file associations), these tests verify
that the *Windows environment* is correctly configured to actually invoke
pyexewrap when a .py file is double-clicked.

These tests can fail due to external system state (MSIX packages, missing
file associations) rather than code bugs. A failure here means pyexewrap
will not be invoked on double-click, even if the unit tests pass.

MSIX Python Manager compatibility:
  Both the shebang approach and ByDefaultActivation via register.py work with MSIX.
  Only activate.py's AppX HKCU layer has no effect (bypassed by App Model).
  See MSIX_COMPATIBILITY.md for the full compatibility matrix.
